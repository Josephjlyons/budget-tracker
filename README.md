## Purpose

A PWA (Progress-Web-APP) that allows uses to enter in their funds whether it be incoming funds or outgoing. If the app is being used in an offline environment and funds are entered in... once the app is back online it will pull the cached data and reflect the changes that were made offline. A chart is nicely attached to fund inputs and will reflect changes based on incoming or outgoing.

## Installation

The live deployed app will take care of the user (no instructions needed).

However if it was needed to run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository on a local machine.
2. Open the apps directory and run a `npm install` to get all dependencies.
3. Create an `.env` file that will store your personal credentials. Follow the `.env.EXAMPLE` model to ensure correct key/value pairs for the MONGODB_URI connection strings.
4. In the command line run `npm run start` to get the server up and running, from there navigate to a browser of choice and access the app by going to `localhost:3000`.
